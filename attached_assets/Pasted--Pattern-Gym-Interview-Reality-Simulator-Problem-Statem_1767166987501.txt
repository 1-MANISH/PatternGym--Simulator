# Pattern Gym + Interview Reality Simulator

Problem Statement

Build an AI-powered professional Pattern Gym + Interview Reality Simulator website with a calm, good design that embodies the Babua philosophy

Most learning platforms overload students with content, courses, and certificates, yet fail to build interview-ready engineers. Students don’t struggle due to lack of resources, but due to lack of structured pattern thinking, real interview exposure, and feedback on how they think under pressure. 
Build a Babua-style learning system that treats engineering skills like a gym — where learners train core problem-solving patterns (notes , video , editorials , tips ) for free and validate them through realistic interview simulations(record their interview and based on solution they submitted and video of interview AI will be anlyszed candidate and suggest improvments).
The platform removes courses, paywalls, and certificates, and instead focuses on pattern mastery, deliberate practice, and interview realism, while sustaining itself through optional, student-friendly value services like mock interviews, feedback, and mentorship.

✅ What We Believe
Patterns > Topics
Thinking > Watching
Reality > Theory
Feedback > Completion
Calm UI > Feature overload
“Babua engineers don’t need motivation. They need clarity.”:
